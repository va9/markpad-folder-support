## Download

### Package Managers

#### Windows (Chocolatey)

```powershell
choco install markpad-app
```

#### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install --cask markpad
```

#### Linux (Snap)

```bash
sudo snap install markpad 
```

### Direct download

Every file below is on the [latest release](https://github.com/sftwrdotdev/Markpad/releases/latest) page, and on [markpad.dev](https://markpad.dev).

| System | Chip | File | |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | Intel / AMD | `Markpad_x.y.z_x64-setup.exe` | installer |
| | Intel / AMD | `Markpad_x.y.z_x64.exe` | portable, no installation |
| | ARM64 | `Markpad_x.y.z_arm64-setup.exe` | installer |
| | ARM64 | `Markpad_x.y.z_arm64.exe` | portable |
| **macOS** | Intel **and** Apple Silicon | `Markpad_x.y.z_universal.dmg` | one file for both |
| **Linux** | x86-64 | `Markpad_x.y.z_amd64.AppImage` | portable, no installation |
| | x86-64 | `Markpad_x.y.z_amd64.deb` | Debian, Ubuntu |
| | x86-64 | `Markpad-x.y.z-1.x86_64.rpm` | Fedora, RHEL, openSUSE |

The two Windows files differ only in that one installs and one does not — `-setup.exe` puts Markpad in Program Files and the Start menu; the plain `.exe` runs from wherever you put it.

> After a direct `.dmg` or Homebrew (macOS), `*-setup.exe` (Windows NSIS) or `.AppImage` (Linux) install, Markpad self-updates from GitHub releases via the in-app *Check for Updates…* entry (macOS app menu, or Settings elsewhere). Chocolatey and Snap keep Markpad current through those package managers instead.
>
> **`.deb` and `.rpm` are one-time installs.** `tauri-plugin-updater` cannot replace a package-managed install, and there is no apt or dnf repository to update from — upgrading means downloading a newer package from the releases page. *Check for Updates…* recognises a package-managed install and tells you so.

## What Markpad renders

Every syntax Markpad renders is in one document — [**download `markdown-syntax.md`**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sftwrdotdev/Markpad/master/samples/markdown-syntax.md) and open it in Markpad: the preview shows each feature working, the editor beside it shows how each one is written ([read it on GitHub](samples/markdown-syntax.md) first if you like). Give the same file to an AI and it knows exactly what Markpad can render: ask it to reformat a document you already have, or to write a new one that uses the whole range — callouts, tables, footnotes, maths, diagrams — and open the result here.

## Installation from source

- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run tauri build` to build the executable 

### Isolated macOS test bundle

For local verification without opening or replacing `/Applications/Markpad.app`, build an unsigned test-only app with an independent identifier:

```bash
MARKPAD_TEST_BUNDLE_ID=dev.example.markpad.test npm run build:test-bundle
```

The result is placed in `dist/test-bundle/`. It is not a distributable release: it has no Developer ID notarization or Windows Authenticode signature.

## Issues & Feedback

If you find a bug, have a feature request, or just want to leave some feedback, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sftwrdotdev/Markpad/issues/new/choose). I'm actively developing Markpad and love hearing from users!

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Markpad is built with SvelteKit and Tauri. 

1. **Fork & Clone** the repository
2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Run the dev server**: `npm run tauri dev` (to run the Tauri app locally)
4. **Make your changes** and ensure type checking passes: `npm run check`
5. **Open a Pull Request**!

Please ensure your code follows the existing style and that you add descriptions for any new features.
