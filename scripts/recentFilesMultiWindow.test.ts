/*
 * The recent-file list was written back as `JSON.stringify(recentFiles)` from
 * the window's own in-memory copy, in three places, with no re-read and no
 * `storage` listener. Markpad opens several windows; each is a separate webview
 * with its own copy of that array and all of them share one localStorage. So
 * every write published a snapshot taken whenever that window last looked, and
 * the later write erased the other window's entries. There was no ordering in
 * which both survived.
 *
 * The fix is the one #370 established for settings: re-read before writing, and
 * let a `storage` listener fold in what the siblings did. This file runs the
 * real module for the merge semantics; the three call sites are asserted
 * against the component's source, because they live in a Svelte file.
 *
 * `recentFiles.ts` reaches `writeStoredSetting` in `settings.svelte.ts`, which
 * is a runes module — hence the shims below, the same ones
 * settingsPersistence.spec.ts uses and for the same reason. Node's test runner
 * gives every file its own process, so they cannot leak.
