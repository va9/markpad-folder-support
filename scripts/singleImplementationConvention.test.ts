// A fixed behavior must have exactly one implementation.

// The bug class this catches: a behavior gets fixed in file A while a stale
// pre-fix copy of the same logic survives in file B. Nothing type-checks the
// copy, nothing imports it, and it looks like a reusable shared helper — so the
// next person to "reuse" or "sync" it silently reverts a merged fix.
//
// The existing behavior tests cannot see this. youtubeExternalFallback.test.ts
// and mermaidPrintTheme.test.ts read hard-coded files, so a second copy living anywhere else is
// invisible to them. Every rule below therefore scans the whole `src` tree and
// pins *which files* are allowed to contain the marker.
//
// A marker is only allowed to be something the compiler cannot see for itself:
// an exported symbol or type name, a magic string handed to another language or
// library (a Tauri command, a Monaco language id, a CSS custom property), or the
// literal shape of a defect that must never come back. A marker must never be a
// private identifier — a parameter name, a local variable, a helper that nothing
// outside its own file can reach. `every rule keeps at least one live
// implementation` below turns every marker into something a rename can break, so
// pinning a private name would promote it to a public contract and make ordinary
// local refactoring fail this suite for no behavioural reason.

// To add a behavior: append a row. `allowed` is the complete set of src-relative
