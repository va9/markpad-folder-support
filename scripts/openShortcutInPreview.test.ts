/**
 * #153: "While in Preview Mode - Ctrl+O doesn't work on windows."
 *
 * It works now — the branch is in the document-level dispatcher, which is
 * attached to `<svelte:document>` rather than to the editor, and it carries no
 * editing condition. What it never had is anything holding it there. The comment on
 * the fix cited a test file that does not exist, and grepping the suite for
 * `selectFile` returned nothing, so the report's own scenario was resting on
 * the absence of a guard nobody had written down.
 *
 * That is the failure mode this file exists for: a shortcut that lives in two
 * layers. `Ctrl+T` already went wrong that way (#392) — Monaco answered it
 * inside the editor and the document handler answered it outside, and the two
 * meant different things. Ctrl+O is answered by both layers as well; what
 * makes it correct rather than a second #392 is that both call the same
 * function, and that is what the second test holds.
 *
 * `documentKeymap` fires real chords at the real imported dispatcher with
 * `isEditing: false` — the reporter's preview mode — and reports what each one
 * means.
