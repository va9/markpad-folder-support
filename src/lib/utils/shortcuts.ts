/**
 * The keyboard shortcuts the app advertises, in one place.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * "What is the shortcut for X" used to be answered in three places that nothing
 * held together: `editorToolbar.ts` (the button tooltip), `TitleBar.svelte`
 * (fourteen hard-coded literals in markup) and the handlers themselves
 * (`editor.addAction` keybindings in `Editor.svelte`, the document-level
 * `keydown` branch in `MarkdownViewer.svelte`). Only the first was ever tested,
 * and only since #480. A shortcuts panel that carried its own list would have
 * been a fourth copy — and the one users would trust most.
 *
 * So this is the single copy the display layers read, and
 * `scripts/shortcutRegistry.test.ts` ties it to the handlers: every chord below
 * is fired at the real code and has to run the command it is labelled with.
 * The registry is not a source of truth about behaviour — the handlers are —
 * it is a claim about them that a test refuses to let drift.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE
 *
 * The clipboard chords (`Mod+C`, `Mod+V`). They are OS conventions rather than
 * app shortcuts, and `Mod+V` is registered as a bare `addCommand` with no id,
 * so listing Copy without Paste would be the more confusing half-answer.
 */

/**
 * Which menu the command would live under. Four of the five labels are the
 * existing menu-bar categories, so grouping the panel cost no new translations.
 *
 * `keys` is the fifth and is not a menu. Enter, Tab, Shift+Tab and the two
 * Mod+Enter keys do different things depending on what the caret is sitting on —
 * continue a list, move to the next table cell, add a table row — and a
 * behaviour attached to a CONTEXT rather than to a command has no menu entry to
 * live under and no command name to be listed as.
 * It was invisible in the app until this group existed: #636 shipped list
 * continuation and nothing anywhere told a user it was there.
