/*
 * WHICH COMMAND a document-level keystroke means — the whole of it, and nothing
 * else.
 *
 * This was the body of `handleKeyDown` in MarkdownViewer.svelte, where it could
 * not be imported and therefore could not be run by a test. What tests did
 * instead was read it: fourteen assertions across four files matched the
 * component's source text for `if (mod && key === 'e')` and its neighbours, and
 * #647 turned five of them red by renaming a local. A source-shape assertion
 * cannot tell a rename from a regression, because it never asks what the code
 * DOES.
 *
 * The same argument as #644's fold drivers, and the same shape of answer: the
 * logic moves out, the wiring stays in. What moves is the part that is a
 * function of the keystroke — the branch structure, every modifier guard, the
 * per-platform scoping. What stays is the part that is genuinely the
 * component's: which of its own functions each command runs.
 *
 * WHY A COMMAND NAME RATHER THAN A HOST OBJECT. The obvious extraction hands
 * the dispatcher the eleven callbacks it used to close over (`closeFile`,
 * `saveContent`, `handleNewFile`, …) as a host argument, the way `FoldHost`
 * carries the fold drivers' three. Eleven is not three: a host that large is
 * the component with its name changed, every caller has to build one, and the
 * test that builds one is back to describing the component rather than running
 * it. So the seam is cut one step earlier, at the question that is actually
 * hard — WHICH command — and the answer is a string the caller switches on.
 * The component's switch is the residue, and it is checked where it lives.
 *
 * WHY IT TAKES NO STORES. Nothing here imports `settings` or `tabManager`;
 * every fact about the app arrives in `KeyContext` as a plain value. That is
 * partly #644's constraint (a store import drags its runes behind every
 * importer) and mostly this one: with no free identifiers there is nothing for
 * a test harness to stub, which is the failure #649 hit — a helper the harness
 * did not know about resolved to a recording stub whose result compared false
 * to everything, so a Windows-only branch reported as firing on all three
 * platforms and the measured chord count went from 51 to 610. A function whose
 * every input is an argument cannot be run against a more agreeable copy of the
 * app, because there is no copy to make.

 * One command the document-level keyboard reaches, named rather than called.

 * to name `tabManager.cycleTab` for both and could not tell them apart.
